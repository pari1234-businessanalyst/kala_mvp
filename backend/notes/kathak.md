# Kathak

Kathak is a classical dance form from North India, known for fast footwork, spins (chakkars), and storytelling by a Kathakar (narrator). It evolved in court and temple contexts, fusing devotional and courtly aesthetics.

Costume varies by gharana and style; music is Hindustani classical with tabla, sarangi, and other instruments. Improvisation and rhythmic play (layakari) are central.
