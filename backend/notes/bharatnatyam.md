# Bharatanatyam

Bharatanatyam is a classical dance form from Tamil Nadu, India. It blends expressive storytelling (abhinaya) with precise footwork, geometric shapes, and codified hand gestures (mudras). Traditional performances follow a structured repertoire (alarippu, jatiswaram, varnam, padam, tillana) and are set to Carnatic music.

Costume typically includes a pleated fan-like sari, temple jewelry, and ankle bells (ghungroo). Face and eye expressions are emphasized to convey stories from Hindu epics and devotional poetry.
